	<h1>My Life of a Transfer Student </h1>
<p> I transfered to University of New Haven from Northwestern Connecticut Community College in Winsted, Connecticut. I graduated with a associate degree in Criminal Justice.At that school i was part of a program called Team success Scholars which shaped me into the young perfessional i am today. I gained finaincial assistance which allowed me to get internships, gas money to get to and from school, and other tools which would help me after my time in the program. This program gave me not just money, but a family. </p>
